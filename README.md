# DH-project

(To read the following text in its intended alignment, it is best to open it through Sublime, Notepad, etc)
For this project, I made a site using Boostrap. index.html is the home page, and other pages can be found through the navigation bar. 

Note:
Sometimes it take several reloads for the html pages to load properly. It is best used on Google Chrome as some features (such as the Carousel) does not always work on Internet Edge.

What I learned in this project:
-implementing a navigation bar and changing its color to the  the ones available in Boostrap
-implementing general text color/background available in Bootstrap
-centering images and making them in the shape of a circle
-centering text
-implementing icons from fontawesome
-adding padding/spacing
-understanding boostrap's grid system (which greatly helped me create various layouts for each page without needing to rely on a pre made theme)
-how to add a line separator (not to be confused with underlining) 
-implementing the new carousel for Boostrap 4

Code Organization
-To organize the code and comments, I first broke them down into major components of the page. Since some sections include incredibly long lines of code, I decided to hide them in order to make the major sections more readable at a glance. The codes corresponding to a specific section can be expanded by hovering on the numbered part of the line of code (on the left part o the screen) and clicking on the downwards arrow. Once expanded, more detailed comments (relating to a specific line for example) can be viewed. Since there are various codes that are similar/idenitical (for ex, grid system code) I only wrote a few comments to indicate the variations instead  of placing them on every line they appear. If viewing the code on Github, the codes will be expanded by default. This only applies if all files are open on sublime.
