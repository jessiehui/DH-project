# DH-project

For this project, I made a site using boostrap. index.html is the home page, and other pages can be found through the navigation bar. 

What I learned in this project:
-implementing a navigation bar and changing its color the ones available in Boostrap
-implementing general text color/background availble in Bootstrap
-centering images and making them in the shape of a circle
-centering text
-implementing icons from fontawesome
-adding padding/spacing
-boostrap's grid system
-how to add a line separator (not to be confused with underlining) 
-implementing the new carousel

Code Organization
-To organize the code and comments, I first broke them down into major components of the page. Since some sections include incredibl y long lines of code, I decided to hide them in order to make the major sections more readable at a glance. The codes corresponding to a specific section can be expanded by hovering on the numbered part of the line of code (on the left part o the screen) and clicking on the downwards arrow. Once expanded, more detailed comments (relating to a specific line for example) can be viewed. Since there are various codes that are similar/idenitical (for ex, grid system code) I only wrote a few comments to indicate the variations instead  of placing them on every line they appear.
